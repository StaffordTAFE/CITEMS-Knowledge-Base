Start at the top of the list and begin allocating work from there. That list should be based on the team’s and the organization’s goals. This has to be the first consideration in terms of how you distribute work. If a project is a top priority and somebody is available to do that work, they should be tasked with that work.</li><li>Skill Sets - Evaluate the skill set of the people who you’re thinking about distributing the work to. If they have the right skill set, you’re going to get a high quality result. The end product will be something that meets your customer’s needs. This also reduces the likelihood of people failing because you’re not giving them work that they don’t have the skill set to perform. You’re giving them something they can be successful with. Undertaking Performance Management with individuals will provide insight to their goals.  Be transparent and communicate that they have been singled out as a protégé, but don’t make any guarantees as the situation can change due to circumstances.  Invest in the professional development of those that you select as a successor.</li></ol>'),

Research the target culture.</li><li>Avoid slang – Nonactive English speakers have a comprehensive understanding of English but not slang idiom and sayings.  They may understand the individual words you have said but not the context or meaning.</li><li>Speak slowly – Modulating your pace will help as will speaking clearly and pronouncing your words properly.</li><li>Keep it simple – avoid using unnecessary large words.</li></ul><p>The same techniques would be used when communicating with individuals that have special needs or disabilities but would ask the person what will help with communication as there are different ways to communicate and be polite and patient.</p>'),

(11, 'Question 8 Workplace Contingencies', '<p>Personal events can often place strain on teams and contingencies need to be put in place for:</p><ol><li>Unplanned leave or absence of workers</li><li>Re-allocation of work tasks</li><li>Succession planning for important team roles</li></ol><p>Describe the contingencies that you have planned for each of the above to ensure that the project objectives can be met.</p>', '<p>Communicate with your staff</p><p>Be clear with your staff about the purpose of their work, expectations, and common goals. You can easily achieve this by having regular office meetings and coming up with a mission statement for your office that encourages a team mentality. By not communicating with employees, you increase the risk of misunderstanding, assumptions, apathy, and lack of loyalty.</p><p>Commit to staff development</p><p>Savvy business leaders are always putting resources towards the continued education of their staff members and helping to develop their skills that will enhance their value to the team. Sending your staff (and yourself) to seminars on communication, emotional intelligence, team building, and leadership training are worthwhile as well. Remember to follow up on these courses by giving staff your ongoing support by ensuring employees use their new skills, encouraging them to be proactive, and implementing effective new policies.</p><p>Offer feedback</p><p>Your staff members should always know where they stand with respect to your company, and by providing them with both casual and formal evaluation you will effectively be showing them that they’re valued, respected, and that their work is acknowledged. Many business owners make the mistake of only providing feedback when it’s negative, but providing plenty of positive feedback will build the confidence of your staff members and will make it more effective when you do need to criticize.</p><p>Encourage collaboration</p><p>Every office needs some collaboration among staff members in order to make the work happen, but there are plenty of benefits to making that collaboration more effective. By creating a space where employees can get to know each other — even if they don’t work closely that often — then you will create a space that is more comfortable and that encourages more creative thinking and brainstorming. Having staff members that know each other and that work well together means that better work will get done more quickly, and more innovation will come of it.</p><p>Be consistent</p><p>No matter how many staff members you have, it’s important that you try to be consistent in your decision-making. Having strong office policies means you don’t “play favorites” and you treat each employee the same, which will make them all feel more valued. Communicate decisions clearly and openly so that everyone knows them at the same time, and handle similar situations involving staff members the same way every time so that each employee knows they are as important.</p><p>Strong teams don’t just appear magically, as you have to work hard to improve communication and respect amongst your staff members. If you really work at it, don’t be surprised if you start noticing positive changes quickly.</p>'),

As a team leader describe several strategies that you will use to develop team cohesion and effectiveness in your project team.</p>', '<ul><li>Listening Coaching is not about the coach, but rather about those that they are coaching.  Listen to their thoughts, needs, and concerns.  Listen in order to:<ul><li>note key points which you can summarize for your coachee to help maintain clarity</li><li>pick up on any unfocused statements and then encourage more clarity</li><li>note the way your coachee responds to determine any underlying issues through further questioning.</li></ul></li><li>Asking open-ended question that focus on three levels<ul><li>First level:  describing the issue</li><li>Second level:  strategic questions – digging deeper</li><li>Third level: strategic questions – helping it change</li></ul></li><li>Making observations Reflect things you observe about a person back to them in a neutral, non-judgment way.  These are only useful when validated by expressing them to the person involved and getting their agreement that the observation is correct and valid.  A well-stated observation may then lead into a coaching or performance conversation.</li></ul>');
